For example, if you are planning to use the Twitter Natural Disaster dataset, then you will describe what the data and where it came as if you were explaining it to someone who does not know anything about the data. You will then describe how this is a __text classification__ problem, and that the labels are binary (e.g. a tweet either refers to a genuine/real natural disaster, or it does not)._ \n",
